## Current Progress - 10/14/2021

### Update
High variance within the group is still not solved yet. We brought out a hypothesis about environment which proved to be unrelated.

Email alert is finished with a new criteria (feed) added which is the proportion of abnormal data within one measurements.

### Problems Encountered
Still haven't find a reasonable explanation for high variance within each measurements with MAX30102, we now begin to think if this is because of the sensor itself. Since we bought two sensor MAX30102, we will make an experiment today.

### Future Plan
Finish the video recording soon.
