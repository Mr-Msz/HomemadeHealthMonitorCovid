## Current Progress - 10/06/2021

### Update
With the help of Adafruit IO, we are able to make the sensor internet connected and read sensor data online.

With the Apple Watch Series 6 from our group member, we performed accuracy and variance checking between MAX30102 and AW Series 6. A total of 180 data points for each devices will be drawn in the future 3-4 days.

### Problems Encountered
It is difficult to compare spo2 between two devices. AW takes 15 seconds to give one reading while the frequency of MAX30102 can't be that low. We will need to find a way to match frequencies.

### Future Plan
Prepare for email alert feature. Right now what is on our mind is ifttt[ifttt.com] which connects apps together.
